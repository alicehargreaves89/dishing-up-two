Newtown, in Inner West Sydney, will always have a place in my heart. I lived here for about a year in probably the best apartment I will ever live in with one of the most fantastic roof terraces. It's an eclectic place with an amazing culture. From crystal shops to Thai food, if you're ever in Sydney it's worth the two stops on the train from the CBD.

Apparently Newtown has the highest concetration of Thai restaurants outside Thailand and I can absolutely believe that. For my shame however, I came to Thai La Ong on a recommendation of a friend and couldn't imagine going anywhere else. Try the red duck curry and the curry puffs and you will not be disappointed.

-------------------

The watermelon cake at Black Star is a Sydney icon. Thinly sliced watermelon layered with rose and strawberry jelly and laden with pistachios this place is just fantastic. 

It's also a great aphrodisiac.

-------------------

The menu has changed a lot in the last couple of years and it seems that the ever popular cronut donut has now left the menu, perhaps too many people had very high increases in cholesterol. This is however, still the place for cronuts (croissant donuts) in Sydney. 


[Pastizzi Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/PASTIZZI-CAFE-287754542104/)
--------------------------

Pastizzi are a traditional savoury pastry from Malta often filled with cheese or meat. They are also little drops of heaven in a delicious flaky pastry. Pastizzi cafe serves an array of flavours as well as homemade filled pasta. Have a few pastizzi for a super tasty and cheap lunch. The cafe has a small number of tables outside and gets very busy during peak hours. 

**You can buy both the pastizzi and the pasta frozen to take home and I would thoroughly recommend doing so.

Sydney has some pretty crazy weather at times and once, on a warm Sydney summers day, we decided to do into a dark heavy metal pub with no windows. Whilst inside, the heavens opened and hail like golf balls fell from the sky. Meanwhile burgers, fried chicken, and a hell of a lot of Jack Daniels were consumed as the hail damaged the roof of the pub and the electrics cut out- so we ended up eating and drinking for free. Ok, so I admit that was a freak incident but Mary's burgers are THE burger to eat in Sydney and the staff here are incredible. This is absolutely one of the funnest places to be.
